The waves crashed onto the beach so loud that he couldn’t hear the footsteps behind him. So he continued, a rhythmical, robotic walk but he was paranoid. Completely paranoid. His hands were shaking in his pockets and a bead of sweat slowly ran down his forehead. He kept telling himself that he had a gun, he was prepared, it would all be fine, why would anyone follow him? How would they know? But this did nothing to comfort him. Nothing.\n\nHis head was spinning but he he still had to focus on the case, he didn’t that they knew. So he had to keep going, keep pushing for more information or they’d never go down.\n\nThere were still footsteps, but still he could not hear them for the violent water was constantly crashing down onto the golden sand. So he carried on walking, continued to think of every single possibility in his head. A knife, a club, a gun? He shivered as he realised it would probably be much worse than that. After 6 and a half months he’d discovered how twisted and cruel these people were. They had no sympathy, no empathy. They could kill a child without giving it any thought. They’d torture him for hours, days, weeks even. There was no chance whatsoever they’d waste the opportunity, that they’d let him go.\n\nHis heart skipped a beat.\n\nAll he glimpsed was a movement behind him, but somehow he knew. He knew they were there for him. To kill him.\n\n“Sergeant.”\n\nHe gulped.\n\nA masked face stepped out in front of him. A noose slung over his shoulder.\n\nThat was the last thing he ever saw."
